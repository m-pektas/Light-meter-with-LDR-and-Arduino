  <H1>Light meter with LDR and Arduino</H1>
	
   Hello there.
   In this project I read the value from the LDR light sensor and printed 
   it on the Celcius screen and set the levels according to the standards
   I set up to turn on the LEDs that express the levels.
   I hope that will be useful.
   Good work..
