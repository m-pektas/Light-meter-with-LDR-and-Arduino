    #-Light meter with LDR and Arduino-#
	
    Hello there.
    In this project I read the value from the LDR light sensor and printed 
    it on the Celcius screen and set the levels according to the standards
    I set up to turn on the LEDs that express the levels.
    I hope that will be useful.
    Good work..
